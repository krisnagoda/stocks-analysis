# 2017 â€“ 2018 Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
Create performant and user-friendly tool to enable self-service analysis of stock data. 

### Purpose
Enable users with data to drive understanding of historical stock performance with the goal of increasing future investment success.

## Analysis and Challenges
This challenge required refactoring of our original stocks analysis code, converting total volume to array rather than single value.

## Results
Refactoring was a big success! As intended, we receive the same results for both 2017 and 2018 analyses but were able to reduce our code runtime by 90%:
